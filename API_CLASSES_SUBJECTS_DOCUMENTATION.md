# Classes & Subjects Management API - Complete Endpoints

## Overview
This API provides complete CRUD operations for managing classes, subjects, and user access control within the checklist app.

## Database Tables
- `classes`: id, name, description, created_at
- `subjects`: id, name, description, created_at
- `class_subjects`: class_subject_id (PK), class_id (FK), subject_id (FK), created_at
- `user_class_subjects`: id, user_id (FK), class_subject_id (FK), assigned_at

All endpoints require admin authentication (Bearer token with role='admin').

## Integration Guide

1. **Database Migration**: Execute DATABASE_CLASSES_SUBJECTS.sql on the server database
2. **API Endpoints**: All PHP files are in `/api/classes/` directory
3. **Admin Menu**: Updated AdminDashboard.js automatically includes menu items for:
   - Classes
   - Subjects
   - User Access
4. **Authentication**: All endpoints check admin role; ensure auth tokens are properly set

## Error Handling
All endpoints return HTTP status codes:
- 200: Success
- 400: Bad request (missing parameters)
- 403: Forbidden (not admin)
- 409: Conflict (duplicate entry)
- 500: Server error

## Notes
- All timestamps use MySQL DATETIME format
- Cascade delete: Deleting a class removes all related class_subjects and user assignments
- Cascade delete: Deleting a class_subject removes all related user assignments
- All endpoints use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
